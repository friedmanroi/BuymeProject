Introduction
Welcome to the Buyme End-to-End Testing Project! My name is Roi, and I am a dedicated automation student at QA Experts College. In this project, I have developed a comprehensive suite of end-to-end tests using Selenium WebDriver and Python. The main focus of these tests is to ensure the functionality and reliability of the Israeli shopping site, Buyme.

Project Overview
Buyme is a popular Israeli shopping website, and my goal is to thoroughly test its various features to provide a seamless user experience for shoppers. I have employed Selenium, a powerful automation tool, along with the elegant and efficient Python package management tool, Poetry.

Features
Full Coverage: The suite of end-to-end tests meticulously covers all crucial aspects of the Buyme website, ensuring that every feature works as expected.

UI Validation: By automating interactions with the website's user interface, I validate that key UI components are functioning correctly, enabling smooth navigation and engagement.

Data-Driven Testing: I have implemented data-driven testing techniques to test various scenarios and inputs, including user registration, product search, and checkout processes.

Continuous Integration: The project is designed for easy integration into continuous integration pipelines, allowing for consistent and reliable testing.
